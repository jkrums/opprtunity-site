        <p>Bill is a co-founder of Opprtunity.com.  As the second best looking member of the team, Bill splits his time between business development and product management for the company.  Bill has been involved in the professional networking space for over 10 years having built two successful networks designed to help professionals connect and market their business online (Fast Pitch / PROskore).
